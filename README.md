## SPHEREx GalSim Cube Simulator

# Summary

This script simulates images in the SPHEREx filters using realistic SEDs and galaxy shapes from COSMOS. These cubes can be used for the SPHEREx simulator to create realistic LVFs.

The fluxes for each of the GalSim COSMOS galaxies are computed based on the EL-COSMOS SEDs (REF) by convolving them with 100 SPHEREx filters.
